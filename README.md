# COSC 374 - Project 3 (Digital Cash)

This is a system that allows money transaction between three parties: a Customer, a Merchant, and a Bank.
<br />
Basically this is an implementation of an electronic cash system, in which the digital cash cannot be copied or reused more than once and the privacy of the customer's identity is guaranteed.
